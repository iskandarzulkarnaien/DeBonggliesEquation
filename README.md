Boggle game with a punny name. Written in Ruby

This game was primarily made with the intention of sharpening my software engineering skills by exploring various design patterns and writing clean and efficient code with an emphasis on extensibility. It is also an exercise in improving my git skills and managing a project on github, as can be seen from the issues and pull requests.
